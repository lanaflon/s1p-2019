=== Event-Driven Architectures for Spring Developers

==== Overview

This repo contains 3 Spring Boot projects

- **update-currency** - A REST application for updating currency conversion rates:
It uses Spring JPA and will auto-create the schema for the `currency` table; the `application.properties` are configured to use a database named `cdc`.

- **from-maxwell** - Receives change events from MySQL via Zendesk Maxwell and a Kafka topic `maxwell` and forwards currency changes to compacted topic `currency`.
Deletions are forwarded as tombstone records.

- **read-currency** - Receives currency events and stores them in a map for instant use within the application.
Java and Kotlin versions are provided.

==== Setup

Install MySQL and Maxwell (I used homebrew on Mac OS).

I had some [authentication issues with MySQL 8, documented here](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/issues/1232).

.my.cnf
```
server_id=1
log-bin=master
binlog_format=row
default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
```

```
CREATE USER 'maxwell'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' AS 'maxwell';
```

==== Running

Run maxwell

```
$ maxwell --user maxwell --password maxwell --producer=kafka --kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092 --kafka_topic=maxwell
```

Run all three boot applications and post a few currency updates:

```
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/update/USD/1000

$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/update/GBP/782

$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/update/EUR/800

$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/delete/EUR
```

Observe the console of the **read-currency** application.
